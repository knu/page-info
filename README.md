# Page Info

This is a Chrome extension that checks for the canonical URL and some basic information about the web page on the current tab.

When a web page is loaded, the extension checks if the URL is canonical and changes its icon face depending on the canonical state.

Clicking the extension icon shows a popup window in which you can view the following pieces of information:

- the canonical URL you can follow or copy (&lt;link rel="canonical"&gt;)
- the site name (og:site_name) and icon (og:icon or &lt;link rel="icon"&gt;)
- the image (og:image)
- the page title (og:title or &lt;title&gt;)
- Twitter flavored meta tags (twitter:*)
- a customizable share URL button (optional)

No SEO hypes, no access to any external server.  This extension serves as a simple information viewer.
