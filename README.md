# Page Info

This is a Chrome extension that checks for the canonical URL and some basic information about the web page on the current tab.

When a web page is loaded, the extension checks if the URL is canonical and changes its icon face depending on the canonical state.

Clicking the extension icon shows the following pieces of information:

- the image (og:image)
- the page title (og:title or &lt;title&gt;)
- the canonical URL you can follow or copy

No SEO hypes, no access to any external server, just a simple information viewer.
